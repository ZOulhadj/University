"""

The third program (Roll the Dice) is responsible
for calculating and simulating the actual and expected
percentage of the total sum given by rolling two dice
a specific number of times.

Notes:
One of the key features of this program is that as a user,
you are able to change the individual settings for the program
such as the number of dice (number_of_dice) that be rolled
as well as the number of sides (number_of_sides) a dice has.

One of the main structures used is a tightly packed dictionary datatype that
looks as such:

    probabilities {
    |    [dice_roll_total] {
    |    |   ["Simulated Percentages"] {
    |    |   |   <simulated_value>
    |    |   },
    |    |   |
    |    |   ["Expected Percentages"] {
    |    |   |   <expected_value>
    |    |   }
    |    |},
    }

Please note that the total size of the dictionary will be
the total number of faces of the dice * number of dice
that can be obtained given the number of face and
die. For example, having 2 dice with 6 faces will give us a size of
12
