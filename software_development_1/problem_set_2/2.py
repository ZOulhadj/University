"""

The second program is intended to print out a list of numbers
that are multiples of 7 going up to the inputted number. For
example, if the user enters 147 then the output would be
7, 14, 21, 28... etc. all the way to 147. The program sets
a minimum number limit of 100 so the user can only enter 101 or
greater.
